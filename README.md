## Introduction
For my final project for 'Introduction to Visual Media Programming', I made a simple game with a theme of a flowerpot falling down a building. The player's goal is to help and save the flowerpot, so it can land safely on the flowerbed on the floor. In this readme file, I will be going over the game and will be going through features I have implemented.
